# Forecasting Financial Crises: Early Warning Systems

### Description 

Financial crises, such as the global recession of 2008, have far-reaching consequences. Predicting these crises is a challenge for economists, traders, and policymakers alike. However, with the help of machine learning and Python, we can build early warning systems (EWS) that detect signals of potential financial disruptions by analyzing key economic indicators.

This codebase will guide you through building a financial crisis early warning system using Python, economic indicators, and machine learning models. Weâ€™ll use ```yfinance``` for historical financial data and ```sklearn``` for building the predictive model.

## Terminal Commands

### Creating the VENV environment

```bash
py -m venv venv
```

    
### Activating the VENV environment

- For Command Prompt - cmd
    
```bash

C:\Users\User\Forecasting-Financial-Crises> venv\Scripts\activate.bat

(venv) C:\Users\User\Forecasting-Financial-Crises> 

```
   
- For Git Bash - bash
    
```bash
User@User MINGW64 ~/Forecasting-Financial-Crises (main)
$ source venv/Scripts/activate

(venv) 
User@User MINGW64 ~/Forecasting-Financial-Crises (main)
$ 

``` 

### Deactivating the VENV environment


- For Command Prompt - cmd

```bash
(venv) C:\Users\User\Forecasting-Financial-Crises> venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat

C:\Users\User\Forecasting-Financial-Crises> 

```
   
- For Git Bash - bash
    
```bash
(venv) 
User@User MINGW64 ~/Forecasting-Financial-Crises (main)
$ deactivate

User@User MINGW64 ~/Forecasting-Financial-Crises (main)
$ 

``` 


## PIP Installs

What was actually installed

```bash
pip install yfinance scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn 

```
